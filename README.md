database.py

This file sets up SQLAlchemy for use in apps like FastAPI by:

creating a database engine (connection manager),

preparing a SessionLocal factory for request-scoped sessions,

defining a Base class for ORM models,

and exposing a get_db() dependency that gives each request its own DB session and ensures it closes after use.


create_engine â†’ builds the connection engine.

connect_args={"check_same_thread": False} is only for SQLite to allow multi-threaded access.

declarative_base â†’ creates a base class (Base) that all ORM models inherit from.

sessionmaker â†’ factory to generate Session objects:

autocommit=False â†’ must call db.commit() manually.

autoflush=False â†’ no automatic flush before queries.

bind=engine â†’ sessions tied to the engine.

Database URL â†’ "sqlite:///./inmemory.db" creates a file inmemory.db in current directory (not true in-memory; thatâ€™s sqlite:///:memory:).

Base = declarative_base() â†’ needed for defining ORM models and creating tables with Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine).

get_db() â†’ FastAPI dependency that:

yields a fresh session per request,

closes it after use (prevents connection leaks).

Can be extended to rollback on errors.


schemas.py 

1. User Schemas

UserBase, UserCreate, UserOut â†’ define input & output formats for user registration, login, and profile data.

Includes validation rules like email format, password length, etc.

UserOut uses from_attributes=True so you can return SQLAlchemy ORM models directly.

2. Authentication Schemas

Token â†’ response schema for JWT login tokens.

TokenData â†’ schema for data stored inside a JWT (e.g., username).

3. Employee Schemas

EmployeeCreate, EmployeeUpdate, EmployeeOut â†’ define rules for adding, updating, and returning employee data.

Example: position, phone number, active status, registration date.

EmployeeOutWithDocuments â†’ extends employee output with associated documents list.

4. Trucker Schemas

TruckerCreate, TruckerUpdate, TruckerOut â†’ similar to employee schemas, but specific to truckers.

Includes trucker-specific fields like driver_license_number, province_of_issue, truck_id_number.

TruckerOutWithDocuments â†’ returns trucker plus their documents.

5. Document Schemas

DocumentCreate, DocumentUpdate, DocumentOut â†’ defines how documents (licenses, insurance, etc.) are created, updated, and returned.

Custom validation in DocumentCreate ensures exactly one of employee_id or trucker_id is set.

Example: canâ€™t create a document without linking it to either an employee or trucker.

6. Search & Dashboard Schemas

LiveSearchResult â†’ defines the format for a single search result (employee/trucker + details).

ComplianceData â†’ schema for compliance dashboards (counts of employees, truckers, documents, verified/unverified).

ArchiveSummary â†’ summarises archived records with a message.

7. Analytics Schemas

These schemas allow reporting/analytics features:

EmployeeGrowthAnalysis â†’ shows monthly employee growth, totals, and projections.

TruckerAnalysis â†’ shows trucker distribution by province/company, and predictive trends.

BusinessImpactAnalysis â†’ high-level metrics like churn rate, compliance rate, revenue/efficiency impacts, and recommendations.



models.py 

1. User Model (users table)

Stores login and identity info.

Fields: username, hashed_password, email, full_name, is_active, is_admin, created_at.

No relationship defined here (users donâ€™t link to documents/employees directly).

Example: Used for authentication, role-based access.

2. Employee Model (employees table)

Represents company employees.

Fields: first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, position, is_active, registration_date.

Relationships:

documents = relationship("Document", back_populates="employee", cascade="all, delete-orphan")

Means: One employee can have multiple documents. If the employee is deleted, their documents are deleted too.

3. Trucker Model (truckers table)

Represents truck drivers in the system.

Fields: first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, driver_license_number, province_of_issue, truck_id_number, company_name, is_active, registration_date.

Relationships:

documents = relationship("Document", back_populates="trucker", cascade="all, delete-orphan")

Same as employees â€” each trucker can have many documents.

4. Document Model (documents table)

Stores documents linked to either an employee or a trucker.

Fields: document_type, file_path, upload_date, is_verified, verification_date, verified_by.

Foreign Keys:

employee_id â†’ links to employees.id.

trucker_id â†’ links to truckers.id.

Relationships:

employee = relationship("Employee", back_populates="documents")

trucker = relationship("Trucker", back_populates="documents").

ðŸ‘‰ Key point: A document belongs to either an employee or a trucker (but not both).

5. ArchivedEmployee Model (archived_employees table)

Stores historical copies of employees after theyâ€™re deactivated/deleted.

Contains almost the same fields as Employee, but with:

original_id â†’ reference to the original employeeâ€™s ID.

archive_date â†’ when the record was archived.

archived_reason â†’ why it was archived.

Ensures no data is lost after deletion â€” just moved to archive.

6. ArchivedTrucker Model (archived_truckers table)

Same concept as ArchivedEmployee, but for truckers.

Keeps driver license, province, truck ID, etc., for audit history.

Also has archive_date + archived_reason.

7. ArchivedDocument Model (archived_documents table)

Historical storage of documents.

Contains all document fields (document_type, file_path, upload_date, etc.) + archival details.

Keeps track of whether it was linked to an employee or trucker before archiving.
